### Terminology
* Web3: In general means blockchain tech with some purpose
* Ethereum: The blockchain we will we be developing with
* Provider: From Ethers docs:
> "A Provider abstracts a connection to the Ethereum blockchain, for issuing
> queries and sending state changing transactions."
* Contract: This is code written in Solidity that has been compiled and
  deployed onto _a_ network.  It has an address that is no different than a
  wallet address.
* Wallet: The blockchain, its a private + public key combo (really you just
  need a private key).

### Technology
* ethers: `import { ethers } from "ethers";`.  This is lib that abstracts the
  complication of communication.
* hardhat: Its backbone of any project these days.  It provides compiling,
  testing, and deployment support
* metamask: Its a browser plugin for wallets.  "The Defacto Standard"

You will notice that in the code on the web I don't reference hardhat.  That is
because hardhat is a support lib.

### Questions?
* Yes we will make another contract right after this.
* I am not going to be able to answer everything.
