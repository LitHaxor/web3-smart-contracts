### Contracts and OOP
Solidity paradigm is very similar to oop.  This is a good thing as we have
state containers with functions for reading / mutation.

### Gas is costly
* Careful, every opcode costs money.
* There is testing framework to help you control it.

### Syntax
Very familiar to a c styled language.
