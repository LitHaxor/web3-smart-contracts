### The idea
I love the idea of RPGs.

### Design
* We want to be able to generate random Hereos.
* The user gets to put in their class of hereo on generation
  * classes: Mage, Healer, Barbarian
  * Class will not influence stats created, therefore getting an epic hero will
    be hard.
* I want to be paid... 0.05 eth per hero!
* stats are randomly generated
  * stats are strength, health, intellect, magic, dexterity
  * A scale of 1 - 18
  * The stats are randomly picked and randomly determined there amplitude according to the following:
    * Stat 1 can max at 18
    * Stat 2 can max at 17
    * Stat 3 can max at 16
    * ...
* You could imagine these being an NFT
  * They are non divisable
