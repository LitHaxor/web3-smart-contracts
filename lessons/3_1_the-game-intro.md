### Its time to take our contracts to the next level.
We need a project to take our contract to the next level.

#### The best way to learn
TIME IN THE SADDLE

### But what is the saddle?

### The idea
I love the idea of RPGs.

### Design
* We want to be able to generate random Hereos.
* The user gets to put in their class of hereo on generation
  * Class will not influence stats created, therefore getting an epic hero will
    be hard.
  * classes: Mage, Healer, Barbarian
* stats are randomly generated
  * stats are strength, health, intellect, magic, dexterity
  * A scale of 1 - 18
* We need a website to generate them from and display your collection.
* We probably don't want these to be fungable...  BUT we will not have time to implement ERC721, nor VRF

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### We are going to build a contract that _could_ become an NFT
* Fulfill ERC721.
* There are other contracts you will have to inherit from.
* There is metadata that is required for certain, say OpenSea.
